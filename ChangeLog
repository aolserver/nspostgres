2007-06-12  Dossy Shiobara <dossy@panoptic.com>

	* Makefile (1.21): Updated Makefile to use AOLSERVER variable
	  (NSHOME is deprecated at this point).  Removed -lnsdb, as it
	  builds against AOLserver 4.0.10 without it, for me at least.

2007-06-12  Dossy Shiobara <dossy@panoptic.com>

	* README (1.6): Correct backslashes with forward slashes.

2007-03-09  Jim Lynch <jim@jam.sessionsnet.org>
	* backed out of defaulting POSTGRES var in Makefile; it should print a 
	message if not defined.

2007-02-17  Jim Lynch <jim@jam.sessionsnet.org>
	* changed functionality and name of new function from two commits ago;
	it now appends to an existing string rather than allocates and returns
	a new string. name changed from stringify_PQresultStatus to
	append_PQresultStatus. added allocation responsibility to caller, who
	now must allocate the string, pass it in, use the result then free the
	string. function docs (in nspostgres.c just above function) altered 
	appropriately.

2007-02-17  Jim Lynch <jim@jam.sessionsnet.org>
	* fixed some places where Tcl_AppendResult didn't have NULL as their
	last parameter

2007-02-17  Jim Lynch <jim@jam.sessionsnet.org>
	* factor:
	we want to add the PQexec result status code to a string, so 
	we will use a Tcl_DString which is a dynamic string. So, create
	a function called stringify_PQresultStatus which returns pointer
	to a newly allocated DString containing the result. This also checks
	whether the incoming result pointer is null.
	* replace where the driver output the result status, with calls
	to stringify_PQresultStatus.
	
2007-02-15  Jim Lynch <jim@jam.sessionsnet.org>
	* Make the output of DbFail() more prettyer.

2007-02-14  Jim Lynch <jim@jam.sessionsnet.org>
	* it didn't, so now I'm moving the message inside the quotation marks
	in the message of the form (exception FOO, "...")

2007-02-14  Jim Lynch <jim@jam.sessionsnet.org>
	* observed that data added to tcl result doesn't all get through,
	so I'm now seeing if removing the newline chars from the message 
	appended to the tcl result lets more of the message through.

2007-02-14  Jim Lynch <jim@jam.sessionsnet.org>
	* in each function that has one, change the name of all local 
	NsPgConn* variables to nspgConn, to make things a little easier
	to read.
	* when driver throws an error message from a call to PQexec,
	add the result status returned from the pg server. For more
	info, see: 
	http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.1/static/libpq-exec.html
	and scroll down to the documentation for the PQresultStatus() func.

2007-02-14  Jim Lynch <jim@jam.sessionsnet.org>
	* The variable PGLIB was meant to hold the path to the libs; the
	build failed when this variable got pg_config --libs. Worked again
	when using pg_config --libdir.

2007-02-14  Jim Lynch <jim@jam.sessionsnet.org>
	* add the ability to specify the fully qualified location
	of the pg_config executable by adding PG_CONFIG=/path/to/it;
	now you can say "POSTGRES=PG_CONFIG PG_CONFIG=/some/where/pg_config"
	and in so doing locate a particular installation of postgres, perhaps
	among many on the same machine, or perhaps not locatable due to 
	not being found along the execution path.

2007-02-14  Jim Lynch <jim@jam.sessionsnet.org>
	* correct a situation where the POSTGRES variable was prematurely
	overwritten. It specifies either where to find a postgres install, 
	or else how to find it. The author of the overwriting code wanted
	to try a pair of standard locations for postgres; as a result of
	my changes it makes those checks only if the POSTGRES variable
	never received a value on the command line.

2007-02-14  Jim Lynch <jim@jam.sessionsnet.org>
	* Hi everybody!
	* This is my first attempt to extend the build system: here, 
	I added "POSTGRES=SEPARATELY PGLIB=... PGINC=..." and
	"POSTGRES=PG_CONFIG".

2003-03-29  Scott Goodwin  <scott@scottg.net>

	* Makefile: Fixed problem where if AS3 was not set, -lnsdb was not
	being added to library list.

	* Makefile: Added OPENSSL setting to allow you to specify where
	OPENSSL is installed. This is required when compiling nspostgres
	against a PostgreSQL installation that has been compiled with OpenSSL.
	If you get lots of undefined symbols that look like _SSL, _PEM and so
	on, then you need this flag.

2004-02-04  Lamar Owen <lowen@pari.edu>
	* Roll a 4.0 tarball.
	* Tag the 4.0 release.

2003-10-02  Scott Goodwin  <scott@scottg.net>

	* Makefile: extra spaces at the end of one of the lines in the
        check-env target were causing make failure. Error given was:

        /bin/sh: -c: line 2: syntax error: unexpected end of file
        make: *** [check-env] Error 2

2003-09-27  Lamar Owen <lowen@pari.edu>

	* Added -lnsdb for AOLserver 4
	* Added AS3 define for Makefile for building with AOLserver 3

2003-02-17  Lamar Owen <lamar.owen@wgcr.org>

	* tagged and released 4.0beta1

2003-01-09  Lamar Owen <lamar.owen@wgcr.org>
	
	* nspostgres.h: changed include order and conditionals for
	AOLserver 4 use.

2002-12-23  Lamar Owen <lamar.owen@wgcr.org>

	* nspostgres release 3.5 Official

2002-12-18  Lamar Owen <lamar.owen@wgcr.org>

	* nspostgres.h and nspostgres.c: corrected some misinformation
	in the comments.

	* nspostgres.h: ChangeLog not in comments anymore; neither is the
	contributor list.

	* corrected contributor list in README.

2002-12-13  Scott S. Goodwin  <scott@scottg.net>

	* Makefile: Added targets for tagging and file release. Do a 'make
	help' to see it.

	* OVERWRITE: I have taken the latest OpenACS version of their postgres
	module and overwritten the "pre-don" version. Had to take postgres.c
	and split it into nspostgres.c and .h. Updated nspostgres Makefile to
	allow compiling with the ACS flag, and to allow setting POSTGRES var
	to "LSB" which will cause the module to look for PostgreSQL libraries
	in the standard Linux locations. Lamar Owen is now primary maintainer
	of this code.

2002-09-29  Scott Goodwin  <scott@scottg.net>

	* STARTING OVER: I'm tagging the nspostgres tree as "pre-don". Don
	Baccus is going to be checking out the tree and either working
	with what I've done here, or replacing it all with the current
	version of the OpenACS postgres module. The name of the module
	will stay nspostgres.

2002-07-01  Scott S. Goodwin  <scott@scottg.net>

	* all: reset file perms to 0644 for all files except the CVS
	directory.

2002-06-02  Scott S. Goodwin  <scott@scottg.net>

	* nspostgres.c: Incorporated latest patches from the postgres
	module that the OpenACS team maintains.

	* TODO: Removed this file.

2001-12-13  Scott S. Goodwin  <scott@scottg.net>

	* TODO: added this file.

2001-12-03  Scott S. Goodwin  <scott@scottg.net>

	* nspostgres.c: Cleaned up the code comments to conform to
	AOLserver coding style. Haven't populated most of the comments yet
	:)
	
2001-09-28  Scott S. Goodwin  <scott@scottg.net>

	* nspostgres.h: Split out from nspostgres.c.

	* Makefile: Cleaned up the Makefile. Fixed a problem where libpq
	wasn't being loaded, so we'd end up with a "function not defined
	error." In the previous version of the postgres driver, the
	libpq.so is used in the EXTRA_OBJS variable. I wonder if this
	means that the libpq.so file is loaded when the nspostgres.so
	module is loaded. I'm not sure how that works. Now, libpq.a is
	being used.

2001-09-08  Scott S. Goodwin  <scott@scottg.net>

	* Makefile: Turned off FOR_ACS_USE (I'll investigate what the
	changes are and possibly integrate that code as the
	default). Commented out lots and used the default include
	$(NSHOME)/include/Makefile.module to handle the make and
	installation process. The following now works:

	make install POSTGRES=/your/path INST=/where/aolserver/is

	* Makefile: changed to accept the
	POSTGRES=/your/postgres/path. This is mandatory. Also changed to
	expect NSHOME to be ../aolserver.

2001-08-31  Scott Goodwin  <scott@scottg.net>

	* ChangeLog: Created this ChangeLog file from the notes in the
	postgres.c file of the original source. This nspostgres module was
	created from the pgdriver2.0 sources found at OpenACS.org.

2001-04-14  Don Baccus  <dhogaza@pacifier.com>

	* Added Henry Minsky's patch which echoes changes in the Oracle
	driver to stream blob data directly to the connection rather than
	first spool to a temp file.  Since the call to return the file to
	the user doesn't return until after the operation is complete,
	spooling was a waste of time and resource.

2001-03-01  Don Baccus  <dhogaza@pacifier.com>

	* Added automatic quoting of emulated bind variables in order to
	make it compatible with the analogous routine in the Oracle
	driver.

2000-12-30  Dan Wickstrom <dcwickstrom@earthlink.net>

	* Added blob_select_file command.  Needed an inverse to
	blob_dml_file to support porting of webmail.

	* Added bind variable emulation to support acs 4.0 porting.

2000-03-28 Lamar Owen <lamar.owen@wgcr.org>

	* Merge with AOLserver 3.0rc1's nspostgres.c -- more error
	checking from Jan Wieck.

	* Also, changed behavior: if the datestyle parameter is not set in
	config file, set it to be 'iso' by default -- it was not getting
	correctly set.

	* Wrapped ACS stuff inside FOR_ACS_USE #ifdef's.

	* Added check for the existence of the PGDATESTYLE envvar and do
	no setting of datestyle if it exists.

	* Take two: make datestyle parameter override envvar, and make the
	default go away.

2000-02-12  John Beimler  <john@radiomind.com>

	* Added a commented-out block showing settings for Debian/GNU
	Linux with package installed AOLserver and PostgreSQL
	
2000-02-06  Lamar Owen <lamar.owen@wgcr.org>
	
	* Added reimplementation of ns_column and ns_table commands --
	adapted the code in the ArsDigita Oracle driver to work in the
	PostgreSQL driver's skeleton.  Will revisit this implementation
	for cleanup once functionality fully verified.

1999-12-13  Lamar Owen  <lamar.owen@wgcr.org>

	* Makefile: Cleaned up assumptions about NSHOME, PGLIB, and PGINC
	locations.

	* Makefile: Added a commented-out block showing settings for
	RedHat Linux with the PostgreSQL RPM's installed.
	
1999-12-01  Don Baccus  <dhogaza@pacifier.com>

	* Don added the following improvements in December of 1999:

	* 1. When a handle's returned to the pool and the handle's in
	transaction mode, the driver rolls back the transaction.

	* 2. Reopens crashed backends, retrying query if told to by
	postmaster.

	* 3. ns_db ntuples now returns the number of tuples affected by
	"insert", "update", and "delete" queries (only worked for select
	before).

	* 4. Supports the following, assuming you've named your driver
	"postgres" in your .ini file:

          [ns/db/driver/postgres]
          datestyle=iso
	
          (or any legal Postgres datestyle)
	  
	* 5. The driver's name's been changed from "Postgre95" to
	"PostgreSQL", the current official name of the database software.
