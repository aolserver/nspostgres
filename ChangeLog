2001-08-31  Scott Goodwin  <scott@scottg.net>

	* ChangeLog: Created this ChangeLog file from the notes in the
	postgres.c file of the original source. This nspostgres module was
	created from the pgdriver2.0 sources found at OpenACS.org.

2001-04-14  Don Baccus  <dhogaza@pacifier.com>

	* Added Henry Minsky's patch which echoes changes in the Oracle
	driver to stream blob data directly to the connection rather than
	first spool to a temp file.  Since the call to return the file to
	the user doesn't return until after the operation is complete,
	spooling was a waste of time and resource.

2001-03-01  Don Baccus  <dhogaza@pacifier.com>

	* Added automatic quoting of emulated bind variables in order to
	make it compatible with the analogous routine in the Oracle
	driver.

2000-12-30  Dan Wickstrom <dcwickstrom@earthlink.net>

	* Added blob_select_file command.  Needed an inverse to
	blob_dml_file to support porting of webmail.

	* Added bind variable emulation to support acs 4.0 porting.

2000-03-28 Lamar Owen <lamar.owen@wgcr.org>

	* Merge with AOLserver 3.0rc1's nspostgres.c -- more error
	checking from Jan Wieck.

	* Also, changed behavior: if the datestyle parameter is not set in
	config file, set it to be 'iso' by default -- it was not getting
	correctly set.

	* Wrapped ACS stuff inside FOR_ACS_USE #ifdef's.

	* Added check for the existence of the PGDATESTYLE envvar and do
	no setting of datestyle if it exists.

	* Take two: make datestyle parameter override envvar, and make the
	default go away.

2000-02-12  John Beimler  <john@radiomind.com>

	* Added a commented-out block showing settings for Debian/GNU
	Linux with package installed AOLserver and PostgreSQL
	
2000-02-06  Lamar Owen <lamar.owen@wgcr.org>
	
	* Added reimplementation of ns_column and ns_table commands --
	adapted the code in the ArsDigita Oracle driver to work in the
	PostgreSQL driver's skeleton.  Will revisit this implementation
	for cleanup once functionality fully verified.

1999-12-13  Lamar Owen  <lamar.owen@wgcr.org>

	* Makefile: Cleaned up assumptions about NSHOME, PGLIB, and PGINC
	locations.

	* Makefile: Added a commented-out block showing settings for
	RedHat Linux with the PostgreSQL RPM's installed.
	
1999-12-01  Don Baccus  <dhogaza@pacifier.com>

	* Don added the following improvements in December of 1999:

	* 1. When a handle's returned to the pool and the handle's in
	transaction mode, the driver rolls back the transaction.

	* 2. Reopens crashed backends, retrying query if told to by
	postmaster.

	* 3. ns_db ntuples now returns the number of tuples affected by
	"insert", "update", and "delete" queries (only worked for select
	before).

	* 4. Supports the following, assuming you've named your driver
	"postgres" in your .ini file:

          [ns/db/driver/postgres]
          datestyle=iso
	
          (or any legal Postgres datestyle)
	  
	* 5. The driver's name's been changed from "Postgre95" to
	"PostgreSQL", the current official name of the database software.
